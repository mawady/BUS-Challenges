This repository contains poster and code for the project on the challenges of segmenting lesions in breast ultrasound images using deep learning.

## Overview

Breast ultrasound imaging is broadly applied for the early detection and diagnosis of breast lesions. As a result, accurate automated detection and segmentation are essential to aid radiologists and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. However, despite its diagnostic value, ultrasound imaging presents challenges such as speckle noise and indistinct lesion boundaries which make accurate segmentation difficult. We evaluate four state-of-the-art deep learning models on two public datasets for breast lesion segmentation.

## Models Evaluated

- UNet
- FPN
- DeepLabv3+
- UNet++
ResNet18 is used as encoder with ImageNet pretrained weights
